<h2>20 years. Thousands of customers. And we’re just getting started!</h2>
	<p>We know first-hand how time-consuming it can be to manage even a single aspect of a good safety program. We’ve seen exactly how complex safety management can be — and we know people’s lives and livelihoods are on the line. Since 2004, we’ve made safety management easier to accomplish by providing software, services, and staffing that solve the most challenging issues facing safety managers and business owners. Our risk-based approach has helped thousands of businesses across the US achieve compliance without sacrificing efficiency. At GSC, we build easy-to-run safety programs that simplify your life, protect your people, and keep your business moving</p>

<h3>We needed a better way to manage safety programs. So we built it!</h3>
	<p>There are several platforms in the safety management space, but many are built by industry outsiders who lack real-world safety experience. GSC is different. We designed our safety services to better support our needs and the needs of our 3,000+ clients.

	We’ve spent years refining our products and services, improving our technology, and layering in services to support any safety and compliance requirement you encounter. By removing the hassle, frustration, and chaos from compliance, we help you focus your energy on the work that truly moves the needle in your business. Partner with GSC to make safe work efficient</p>
